class BaseApiClient(abc.ABC, Generic[StubT]):
    """A base class for API clients.

    This class provides a common interface for API clients that communicate with a API
    server. It is designed to be subclassed by specific API clients that provide a more
    specific interface.

    Some extra tools are provided to make it easier to write API clients:

    - [call_stub_method()][frequenz.client.base.client.call_stub_method] is a function
        that calls a gRPC stub method and translates errors to API client errors.
    - [GrpcStreamBroadcaster][frequenz.client.base.streaming.GrpcStreamBroadcaster] is
        a class that helps sending messages from a gRPC stream to
        a [Broadcast][frequenz.channels.Broadcast] channel.

    Example:
        This example illustrates how to create a simple API client that connects to a
        gRPC server and calls a method on a stub.

        ```python
        from collections.abc import AsyncIterable
        from frequenz.client.base.client import BaseApiClient, call_stub_method
        from frequenz.client.base.streaming import GrpcStreamBroadcaster
        from frequenz.channels import Receiver

        # These classes are normally generated by protoc
        class ExampleRequest:
            int_value: int
            str_value: str

        class ExampleResponse:
            float_value: float

        class ExampleStub:
            async def example_method(
                self,
                request: ExampleRequest  # pylint: disable=unused-argument
            ) -> ExampleResponse:
                ...

            def example_stream(self) -> AsyncIterable[ExampleResponse]:
                ...
        # End of generated classes

        class ExampleResponseWrapper:
            def __init__(self, response: ExampleResponse):
                self.transformed_value = f"{response.float_value:.2f}"

        class MyApiClient(BaseApiClient[ExampleStub]):
            def __init__(self, server_url: str, *, connect: bool = True):
                super().__init__(
                    server_url, ExampleStub, connect=connect
                )
                self._broadcaster = GrpcStreamBroadcaster(
                    "stream",
                    lambda: self.stub.example_stream(ExampleRequest()),
                    ExampleResponseWrapper,
                )

            async def example_method(
                self, int_value: int, str_value: str
            ) -> ExampleResponseWrapper:
                return await call_stub_method(
                    self,
                    lambda: self.stub.example_method(
                        ExampleRequest(int_value=int_value, str_value=str_value)
                    ),
                    transform=ExampleResponseWrapper,
                )

            def example_stream(self) -> Receiver[ExampleResponseWrapper]:
                return self._broadcaster.new_receiver()


        async def main():
            client = MyApiClient("grpc://localhost")
            response = await client.example_method(42, "hello")
            print(response.transformed_value)
            count = 0
            async for response in client.example_stream():
                print(response.transformed_value)
                count += 1
                if count >= 5:
                    break
        ```

        Note:
            * In this case a very simple `GrpcStreamBroadcaster` is used, asuming that
                each call to `example_stream` will stream the same data. If the request
                is more complex, you will probably need to have some kind of map from
                a key based on the stream method request parameters to broadcaster
                instances.
