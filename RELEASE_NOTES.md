# Frequenz Client Base Library Release Notes

## Summary

<!-- Here goes a general summary of what this release is about -->

## Upgrading

- `GrpcStreamBroadcaster` now takes a `AsyncIterable` instead of a `AsyncIterator` as the `stream_method`. This is to match the type of streaming methods generated by `grpc`, so no conversion to an `AsyncIterator` is needed.
- gRPC URLs don't have a default port anymore, unless a default is set via `ChannelOptions`. If you want to set a default port for URLs, please pass custom `ChannelOptions` as `defaults` to `parse_grpc_uri` or as `channel_defaults` to `BaseApiClient`.
* The `ExponentialBackoff` and `LinearBackoff` classes now require keyword arguments for their constructor. This change was made to make the classes easier to use and to avoid confusion with the order of the arguments.

## New Features

- Added support for http2 keep-alive.
